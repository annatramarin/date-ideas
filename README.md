# date_ideas
Out of ideas for your next date? Get a suggestion in a couple of clicks! You can also choose an activity according to the current season.

Many of the date activities suggested here are taken from [this website](https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/relationships/a31405192/cute-romantic-date-ideas/), but with an additional surprise effect.

If you haven't already, install tkinter on your machine.

```
pip install tkinter
```

Then clone the repository on your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/annatramarin/date_ideas.git
```

Access the repository and launch the script using the command `python` or `python3`.

```
python date_ideas.py
```


The following window should pop up:

  </p>

If you click on "No", a date suggestion will be picked from the [general.txt](https://github.com/annatramarin/date_ideas/blob/main/general.txt) list.

If you click on "Yes", you can further choose a season and get a season-tailored (sort of) suggestion.

You can of course modify the lists as you like.
